# Python Learning Curriculum Overview

## Course Introduction
Welcome to your Python learning journey! This curriculum is designed for someone who understands basic math (addition, subtraction, etc.) but is new to programming. We'll start with the fundamentals and build up systematically to ensure you master each concept perfectly.

## Learning Philosophy
- **Gradual Progression**: Each lesson builds on the previous one
- **Hands-On Practice**: Every concept includes multiple exercises
- **Perfect Understanding**: We won't move forward until you're comfortable
- **Live Coding**: Interactive exercises we'll practice together
- **Special Focus**: Conditional logic will be taught thoroughly

## Course Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation (Lessons 1-4)
1. **Data Types & Variables** - Understanding Python's basic building blocks
2. **Basic Operations** - Mathematical and string operations
3. **Input/Output** - Interacting with users through print() and input()
4. **Working with Data** - Combining what we've learned

### Phase 2: Control Flow (Lessons 5-7)
5. **Conditional Logic Part 1** - if statements and basic conditions
6. **Conditional Logic Part 2** - elif, else, and complex conditions
7. **Conditional Logic Mastery** - Advanced patterns and best practices

### Phase 3: Data Structures (Lessons 8-9)
8. **Lists Fundamentals** - Storing and accessing multiple values
9. **Lists Operations** - Manipulating and working with lists

### Phase 4: Iteration (Lessons 10-11)
10. **For Loops** - Repeating actions with for loops
11. **While Loops** - Conditional repetition

### Phase 5: Advanced Concepts (Lessons 12-15)
12. **Functions Basics** - Creating reusable code blocks
13. **Functions Advanced** - Parameters, return values, scope
14. **Dictionaries** - Key-value data storage
15. **Error Handling** - Dealing with mistakes gracefully

## How to Use This Curriculum

1. **Read the Theory**: Each lesson starts with explanations and examples
2. **Practice Exercises**: Complete all exercises before moving on
3. **Live Coding**: We'll work through interactive examples together
4. **Check Understanding**: Don't hesitate to ask questions or review
5. **Build Projects**: Apply concepts in small projects

## Exercise Types

- **Quick Practice**: Short exercises to test basic understanding
- **Hands-On Coding**: Longer exercises that build real skills
- **Live Exercises**: Interactive problems we'll solve together
- **Challenge Problems**: Optional advanced exercises
- **Mini Projects**: Combine multiple concepts

## Prerequisites
