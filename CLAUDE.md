# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python learning repository designed for teaching Python fundamentals through hands-on practice. The project focuses on creating educational materials and exercises for students learning Python from basic concepts to more advanced topics.

## Specialized Agent

The repository includes a custom `python-basics-tutor` agent specifically designed for Python education:

- **Purpose**: Provides structured, hands-on Python learning with gradual progression
- **Teaching Philosophy**: Slower-paced instruction prioritizing comprehension over speed
- **Approach**: Each concept includes explanations, hands-on exercises, and practical application
- **Curriculum**: Systematic progression from data types to object-oriented programming

Use this agent when:
- Teaching Python fundamentals
- Creating educational content
- Providing step-by-step Python instruction
- Developing practice exercises

## Content Creation Guidelines

Based on the project requirements (prd.md):
- Create documentation in Markdown (`.md`) files only
- Focus on practical exercises and hands-on experience
- Start with data types and build systematically
- Emphasize conditional logic mastery
- Provide live coding exercises

## Development Approach

When working in this repository:
1. Use the `python-basics-tutor` agent for educational content creation
2. Create structured lesson plans with exercises
3. Include practical coding examples for each concept
4. Ensure progressive difficulty in exercises
5. Focus on foundational understanding before advancing
